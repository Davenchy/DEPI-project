# DevOps

This directory contains all the necessary files to run a local Gogs + Jenkins + Ansible pipeline.

## Pipeline Steps

1. On any git push to the Gogs repository, it triggers the Jenkins pipeline through a webhook.
2. Jenkins clones the Gogs repository, installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the project.
3. After the project is built, it is deployed to the production server by building a Docker image and pushing it to Docker Hub.
4. Finally, Jenkins runs Ansible to install Docker, configure the firewall (UFW), and run the Docker image.

## Prerequisites

Docker must be installed on the host machine as everything depends on Docker.

## How to Use

Create directories in the `devops` directory to mount as volumes for Gogs and Jenkins:

```bash
cd devops
mkdir gogs jenkins_home
```

Now, build and run the Docker Compose services:

```bash
docker compose --build up
```

This will build the Jenkins and Gogs containers from `jenkins_dockerfile` and `gogs_dockerfile`, and start them.

Once the services are running, set up the Jenkins pipeline and credentials following the [Jenkins Setup](docs/jenkins_setup.md). Then configure your Gogs repository and push your code to it following the [Gogs Setup](docs/gogs_setup.md).

## Ports

- **Jenkins Server:** 8080
- **Gogs:** http: 3000, ssh: 8022

## Jenkins Container

The Docker Compose file builds the container from `jenkins_dockerfile`, which is based on the `jenkins/jenkins:alpine` image.

The following Jenkins plugins are installed:

- **docker-workflow**: Enables Docker integration in the pipeline to run Bun and build deployment images.
- **ansible**: Enables the use of Ansible within the pipeline.
- **gogs-webhook**: Triggers the Jenkins pipeline on Gogs webhook requests.
- **slack**: Sends notifications to Slack for pipeline updates.

Additionally, these packages are installed:

- **docker-cli**: The Docker command-line tool (without the engine).
- **docker-cli-buildx**: The Buildx plugin for Docker.
- **ansible**: To be used in the pipeline.

Finally, the `jenkins_entrypoint.sh` script is copied to the container. This script creates a Docker group with the same GID as the host and adds the Jenkins user to that group. It then starts the Jenkins entrypoint script.

## Gogs Container

The Docker Compose file builds the Gogs container from `gogs_dockerfile`, based on the `gogs/gogs:latest` image.

The `gogs-config.ini` file is copied to configure the Gogs server. Key settings include:

- Database type set to `sqlite3`.
- Default branch set to `main`.
- GZip enabled.
- SSH port set to 8022 (as configured in the Docker Compose file).
- Gogs uses its built-in SSH server.
- Captcha protection disabled.
- The `jenkins` host added to the `LOCAL_NETWORK_ALLOWLIST`.
- The main config screen is disabled for the first run.

## Ansible

The `ansible/` directory contains the `Ansible.yml` playbook, `ansible.cfg`, and the `hosts` file.

If the `hosts` file does not exist, create it and add your deployment server's IP address.

The playbook performs the following actions on the deployment server:

- Updates the apt cache.
- Installs Docker.
- Configures and enables the firewall (UFW).
- Runs the Docker image pushed to Docker Hub.

## Jenkinsfile

This is the Jenkins pipeline file. For more information, refer to the [Jenkinsfile](docs/jenkinsfile.md).

## Deployment Dockerfile

The `deploy_dockerfile` is used to build the deployment image by copying the `dist/` directory (generated by running `bun build`).

The deployment image is based on the `nginx:alpine` image.

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains entrypoint shell scripts for the containers to perform tasks before executing the actual container entrypoint.

- **Gogs Entrypoint:** Ensures that your configuration is properly set if it's the first time running the Gogs container.

- **Jenkins Entrypoint:** Verifies that the Docker group has the correct GID and ensures the Jenkins user is added to the Docker group.
